There's not much to this scraper and it is just a byproduct of boredom.
It's currently using the JSON reddit API documented at
https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/API

If you look at the code, you should see how it works. I know alot
is lacking and sloppily done but it isn't a real project. Maybe 
someday I will get around to adding some useful features to it or 
making it a dependable library. Much needs to be done in the way of
recursion optimization and handling the reddit API data structures.
As of this wirting, it's not complete.
