There's not much to this scraper and it is just a byproduct of boredom.
It's currently using the JSON reddit API documented at
https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/API

If you look at the code, you should see how it works. I know alot
is lacking and sloppily done but it isn't a real project. Maybe 
someday I will get around to adding some useful features to it or 
making it a dependable library. This script can take a while because
of the rate limit imposed by reddit and the fact that many deeply
buried pages are not cached so they have to be freshly generated.

Be careful with the scandepth(sd) and secondary scandepth(secsd), since
this loads the pages in the following fashion:
       One page for each sd
     + 25 post comment pages for each page(25 posts per subreddit page)
     + secsd*numberOfComments on each post
This can use up quite a bit of memory, although bandwidth is throttled.
